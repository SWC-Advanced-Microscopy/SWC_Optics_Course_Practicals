\textbf{\Large{Laser Routing and Alignment}}
\end{center}

A thorough understanding of beam alignment is critical for building a scanning microscope. 
`Beam alignment' refers to the process of routing a laser beam precisely along a defined path. 
Optical elements such as lenses are generally inserted into the path defined by the beam. 
In most situations the laser is in a fixed position and is directed using flat \textit{first surface} mirrors.
The aim of this exercise is to redirect a laser beam through a specific line at a specific height above the table using two mirrors.
Do not touch the reflective mirror surfaces!


\section{Aligning the beam through a path defined by two points}
Your goal is to set up a laser pointer, two mirrors, and two irises in order to achieve the state shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ex1}. 
The beam should pass straight through the irises, the exact locations of the other components is not important. 
The mirror holder mounted on the rail ($mirror_2$) should be a KM100CP/M. 
Separate the irises by as much space as possible and keep $mirror_2$ fairly close to $iris_1$.
Once this is established, add $mirror_1$ such that it is square with $mirror_2$ and at least about $10~cm$ away from it. 
Finally, set up the laser pointer such that the beam hits $mirror_1$.
Now the fun starts\ldots

\label{fig:ex1}
\end{figure}


The goal is to have the beam pass through the two iris centres without moving the laser pointer. 
In most cases it will be possible to complete the exercise simply by altering the tilt of the mirrors and rotating the mirror posts in their holders. 
If the mirrors are initially very mis-positioned you might also need to translate them across the table. 
To complete the exercise you will need to understand the following keys points:

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
\item Adjusting $mirror_1$ \textit{translates} the beam across the surface of $mirror_2$.
\item Adjusting $mirror_2$ alters \textit{the angle} with which the beam goes through the irises. 
\item As a consequence of (1), you adjust $mirror_1$ to pass the beam through $iris_1$.
\item As a consequence of (2), you adjust $mirror_2$ to pass the beam through $iris_2$.
\item Iteratively adjusting the two mirrors will always allow the beam to pass through both irises, assuming that there exists a region of $mirror_2$ that falls along the axis defined by the two irises. 
\end{enumerate}


Here is how you will implement the above:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Close $iris_1$ and adjust $mirror_1$ to position the beam at the centre of $iris_1$. \textit{Use the adjustment screws for fine positioning only. For coarse postioning, rotate the post.}
\item Open $iris_1$ and rotate $mirror_2$ to position beam at centre of closed $iris_2$. 
The process of doing this will move the beam away from the centre of $iris_1$. 
The degree to which this happens depends on the distance between $mirror_2$ and $iris_1$.
\item Close $iris_1$ and assess the beam position. If not aligned, repeat steps 1 \& 2. 
If aligned, stop. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tips}
\begin{itemize}
\item If after repeated attempts at alignment you keep failing, this indicates that a mirror (probably mirror 2) is mis-positioned. 
\item Only use right angles. 
Whilst it is possible to use very acute angles and still solve the alignment task, you will have a larger mirror area to play with if you reflect the beam at 90 degree angles.
\item Manage your real-estate: You will notice that sometimes, the beam will fall off $mirror_2$. This problem can be solved by using a larger mirror, or by translating $mirror_2$ in the direction where the beam fell off its edge.
\end{itemize}


\section{Getting the beam parallel with the table}
Your 2-photon laser has arrived and it's time to begin building your microscope's light path. 
To make your life easier, you decide to use two mirrors to ensure that the beam emerging from the laser comes out parallel with the optical table and at a height suitable for your lenses and other optical elements. 


Set up your laser pointer and two mirrors as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ex2}. 
The mirrors can be as close to the laser as you like. 
Place an iris on a post holder and use a post base to improve stability. 
Do not bolt the iris to the table.
This single iris defines the height at which you want the beam to be at all locations on the optical table. 
Based on what you learned in Exercise~1, use the iris and the two mirrors to ensure the beam is parallel with the table at the height defined by your iris. 
Hint: all you're allowed to do is change the tilt of the two mirrors and translate the iris across the table.
